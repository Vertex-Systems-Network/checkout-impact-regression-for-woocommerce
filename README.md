# WPEssential Checkout Impact Regression

A planned WPEssential add-on that detects how plugin updates and checkout or payment configuration changes affect real customer checkout scenarios.

It is designed to answer **what changed, for whom, and where** by comparing saved cart and customer scenarios before and after a change. The primary output is a clear impact report, for example:

- **Germany:** expected shipping method is missing.
- **United Kingdom:** shipping cost changed from $7 to $12.
- **United States:** checkout behavior is unchanged.
- **WELCOME10:** applied discount differs from the saved expectation.

This is a change-impact regression tool. Checkout pass/fail monitoring is useful context, but the product's core job is comparing expected checkout behavior across saved scenarios.

## Project status

This repository is in the **pre-development planning** stage. The plan below is the source of truth for phases and progress. Dates are recorded as YYYY-MM-DD; **TBD** means the schedule has not yet been estimated.

| Phase | Status | Progress | Start date | End date |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| 0. Project brief and AI handoff foundation | Complete | ██████████ 100% | 2026-11-06 | 2026-11-06 |
| 1. Market and competitor research | Complete | ██████████ 100% | 2026-11-06 | 2026-11-06 |
| 2. Requirements and compatibility matrix | Complete (planning) | ██████████ 100% | 2026-11-06 | 2026-11-06 |
| 3. Options bank and system architecture | Complete (planning) | ██████████ 100% | 2026-11-06 | 2026-11-06 |
| 4. Checkout scenario and comparison design | Complete (design) | ██████████ 100% | 2026-11-06 | 2026-11-06 |
| 5. UX and React-based admin interface | Complete (UX/prototype) | ██████████ 100% | 2026-11-06 | 2026-11-06 |
| 6. Pre-development technical proof | In progress (protocol complete; runtime proof blocked) | ██░░░░░░░░ 25% | 2026-11-06 | TBD |
| 7. Plugin implementation and verification | Not started | ░░░░░░░░░░ 0% | TBD | TBD |
| 8. Release readiness | Not started | ░░░░░░░░░░ 0% | TBD | TBD |

**Overall planning progress: 69%** — unweighted average across the nine tracked phases, with Phase 6 at 25% for documented protocol/research work (Phases 0–5 complete for their documented planning/design deliverables). Phase 5 delivers the React production-interface blueprint and interactive UX concept; the prototype is not connected to WooCommerce. Safe checkout replay and runtime compatibility remain unvalidated.

## Start here

1. Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) before making project changes. It explains how AI coding tools should work in this repository.
2. Read the [Development Plan](docs/DEVELOPMENT-PLAN.md) for scope, phases, requirements, research areas, and acceptance criteria.
3. Use [AI tool instruction loading](docs/AI-TOOL-RULES.md) to confirm the correct entry point for Cursor, Claude, Gemini, or ChatGPT.
4. Check the [competitor research report](docs/research/COMPETITOR-RESEARCH.md) for dated findings and source links.
5. Use the [deduplicated options bank](docs/research/OPTIONS-BANK.md) and [system inventory](docs/architecture/SYSTEM-INVENTORY.md) before adding scope or proposing architecture.
6. Read the [proposed architecture and data flow](docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [shipping/payment integration matrix](docs/architecture/INTEGRATION-MATRIX.md).
7. Read the [scenario and comparison specification](docs/design/SCENARIO-AND-COMPARISON-SPEC.md) before changing scenario, baseline or diff semantics.
8. Review the [admin UX/React specification](docs/design/ADMIN-UX-SPEC.md) and [interactive interface prototype](docs/design/admin-interface-prototype.html) for the planned screens and states.
9. Read the [requirements and compatibility plan](docs/requirements/REQUIREMENTS.md); planned targets are not tested compatibility claims.
10. For Phase 6 checkout safety research and the runtime proof checklist, read [Pre-development safe checkout proof](docs/validation/PREDEVELOPMENT-SAFE-CHECKOUT-PROOF.md).
11. Update the phase status, progress bar, start date, and end date in this README when project progress changes. Keep detailed decisions and evidence in the development plan.

## Product principles

- Compare saved, representative customer/cart scenarios before and after a plugin or settings change.
- Report material differences by country/region, shipping method and cost, payment option, taxes, coupons/discounts, and checkout completion behavior where supported.
- Distinguish a confirmed regression from an environment-dependent or inconclusive result.
- Make comparison results understandable to store owners, with evidence and a clear expected-versus-observed view.
- Keep scenario data, customer privacy, store performance, accessibility, and recovery behavior in the architecture from the start.
- Use a polished, human-centered React interface that fits naturally into WordPress administration.
- Finalize and document PHP, WordPress, WooCommerce, WPML, and Polylang compatibility before implementation scope is locked.
- **Do not add a CLI to the product before the final release.** No CLI product interface or CLI commands are in scope during planning and implementation.
- Do not claim compatibility or automated detection capability until it has been validated.

## Planned research references

Competitor research begins in Phase 1. Initial references supplied for review:

- [Cart Lookout](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cartlookout/)
- [ShopMonitor](https://shopmonitor.io/)

Research must verify the current feature set and limitations from primary product materials, record findings and sources, and use them to build a deduplicated options bank. No feature should be copied into scope without a user need, rationale, and acceptance criteria.

## Planned distribution

The release target is a **free edition for the WordPress.org Plugin Directory** and a **paid edition for the WooCommerce.com Marketplace**. These are planning targets only; neither marketplace application nor product submission has been made. The free edition must provide genuine standalone value and comply with WordPress.org's licensing and no-trialware rules. Paid packaging, update ownership, pricing and cross-marketplace presentation still require review.

See the [distribution and marketplace submission plan](docs/release/DISTRIBUTION-PLAN.md) for current requirements, release gates, edition decisions and official references. The proposed $119/year price is not approved.

## License

No license has been selected yet. A GPL-compatible release license is a submission prerequisite and remains a decision.
